I'm affiliated with the [Knowledge and Concepts Lab](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) and the [Stanford Social Interaction Lab](https://socialinteractionlab.github.io/) at Stanford. Prior to joining as a PhD student, I worked as a Research Specialist at the [Visual Cognition Lab](https://emilyward.org/wordpress/) after graduating from undergrad in 2019. During my undergrad, I spent a summer at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working at the [Serre Lab](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/person/thomas-serre/). I also spent 6 months at [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/in.html) in Bangalore, India as a R&D intern during spring 2019.

In another life, I was a child actor. One of my tv series, aired on [Indian National television (Doordarshan)](https://prasarbharati.gov.in/dd-national-homepage/). One of my [short films on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjlzhPHOIHY&ab_channel=RunwayReel-TeluguLatestShortFilms) has about 3.7 million views. In my free time, I love playing the guitar, writing songs and playing table tennis. I have made the [anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqzddi6MSpY&ab_channel=HyderabadHunters) for [Hyderabad Hunters](http://hyderabadhunters.com/) which is a team in the [Premier Badminton League](https://www.pbl-india.com/).
