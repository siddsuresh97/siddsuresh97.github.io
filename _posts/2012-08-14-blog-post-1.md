Step by step guide
======
1. Find a template that you want to start with. I have used https://academicpages.github.io/ on my website
2. Follow the steps on the 'Getting Started' section of the homepage of academic pages.
3. Follow the steps under 'Publishing from a branch' in [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) link.



If you want to buy a domain with your name eg, johndoe.com, blah blah blah
- 

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
