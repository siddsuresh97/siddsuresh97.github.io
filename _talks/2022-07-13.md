This talk was catered to students who participated in the undergraduate summer research program [PREP](https://psych.wisc.edu/nsf-reu-site-psychology-research-experience-program/about-prep/) offered by the department of psychology at University of Wisconsin - Madison. As part of the data science workshop, I talked about how students could use Convolutional Neural Networks to run psychophysics experiments in their research. I also talked about how Large Language Models (like GPT-3) could be used to run feature listing tasks and triplet matching tasks in order to compare conceptual representations from humans and large language models.
